BUGS:

- settings.ini is generated using the test string value for RECHECK_ENABLED if testing is performed without an existing settings.ini file.

- _platform does not set correctly (at least not on win10)


FEATURES:

- Basic UI wrapper for all those non terminal using normies (eventually).
- Deep searches. Search in subdirectories for files.


FURTHER WORK:

- linux/darwin functionality needs to be tested / have tests made for it.

- removeFile has not been made with linux/darwin in mind at all. exisitng code might work, but probably not.

- unit tests need to be expanded to include moving files without fucking up everything or being to compicated to set up.
	Maybe migrate unit tests to a seperate class that also generates files to test with, then remove/hide for releases.


CHANGES:

- default file permissions setting should be a somewhat sane value, not 777.
